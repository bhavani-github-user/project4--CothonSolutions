Cloud-Based Identity & IAM System with AWS Cognito

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) system using Amazon Cognito. The system handles user authentication and authorization for a web application, providing secure access to resources based on user roles and permissions.

The IAM system is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to integrate with your web application. It uses AWS Cognito for user management and integrates with IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources like S3, DynamoDB, and other services.

Key Features

User Authentication: Integrated Cognito User Pool for managing user sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery.

Role-Based Access Control: Created IAM roles with different access levels (e.g., Admin, User) and linked them with Cognito to control access to AWS resources.

Seamless Web App Integration: Used AWS Amplify for easy integration with the web application, handling user login and registration.

Secure Access to AWS Resources: Set up Cognito Identity Pool for providing temporary AWS credentials to authenticated users, allowing them to access resources like S3, Lambda, etc.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enabled additional security through multi-factor authentication for user login.


Technologies Used

Amazon Cognito (User Pool, Identity Pool)

AWS IAM (Roles, Policies)

AWS Amplify (for web app integration)

AWS Lambda (for backend functions)

AWS S3 (for file storage, optional)

AWS DynamoDB (for database, optional)


Project Setup

Prerequisites

An AWS account with access to Cognito and IAM services.

Node.js and npm installed on your machine (if you're using AWS Amplify for integration).

Basic understanding of AWS services like Cognito, IAM, and S3.
